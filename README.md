# FortifyAnalysisResultsHelper

The results of the static code analysis made by Fortify tool can be viewed in user interface provided by the MicroFocus. However, this UI is only available for those who have the license to carry out the analysis in the first place. The ones without the license can only view pdf file that is generated by the Fortify, after static code analysis ends. Therefore, they cannot benefit from the user interface and has to go over usually 1000+ page long pdf file to resolve security vulnerabilities. Main objective of this project was to develop web application with similar user interface for the results of static code analysis generated by Fortify software so that people with no access to official user interface can also view the results of the static code analysis in systematic way.
